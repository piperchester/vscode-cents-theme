### Build

```shell
# after cloning
yarn
yarn build  # repackages .vsix file
yarn clean  # wipes .vsix files
```

### Install

Once we have a `.vsix` package (after running `npm run build`), we're able to install the theme.

From VS Code,
1. `cmd+shift+p` to open command palette
1. Type "**ext**" and select "**Extensions: Install Extensions**" to open the Extensions sidebar
1. Click the `...` menu in the upper right corner of the sidebar
1. Choose "**Install from VSIX**"
1. From Finder, select the `.vsix` file that we generated in `npm run build`. Once selected, it should appear in the extensions sidebar
1. Done!

If you need to toggle to the theme, go to `Preferences > Color Theme > Cents`. If you need to reinstall, search for "**cents**" in the Extensions sidebar.
